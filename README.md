Leveraging SAT/SMT and BNN/PINN to Design safety-critical systems

1. Approximation of hybrid systems with BNNs
we have adapted BNNs with different architectures, including simple Feedforward Neural Network (shortly BFFNN), Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN), and also  Physics-Informed Neural Network (BPINN), to approximate both the continuous evolution modeled by differential equations (e.g., nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation) and hybrid model (e.g., bounding ball).  

2. Approximation of hybrid systems with PINNs and SMT (ongoing)
Our ongoing attempt is to adapt PINNs framework to be combined with SAT/SMT together with over- and under-approximations.
